This project is called "MYTHOS." It's not actually a piece of software. The project is like Magic the Gathering, and basically what you do is you create cards, using my template, and then you can fork the repository, add your cards that kind of thing. There are no operating system requirements because there is no app (yet). I just ask that you don't break the law, use ai art unless you're good at drawing, and don't make up stupid names. The last two are the biggest requirements. I have added in a document that you can download and use to create your own cards.  Please make sure your cards are in a universal image format OR PDFs. That's all!
